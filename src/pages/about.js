                    Hi, I'm <ChakraLink href='https://bobbybytez.io'>Bobby Hall Jr</ChakraLink> creator of hot seat questions. 
                    A little about me... 
                    I live in Vermont and i'm a Full Stack Engineer. I'm passionate about UX/UI and front-end development but I love solving hard problems on the backend.
                    For the past year I have been working with diverse remote teams and building products at Lambda School. About 5 months ago I got promoted to team lead where I lead 10+ Web developers, 4 IOS developers, and 4 UX designers, Through 2 product cycles releasing new features each cycle.

                    Hot Seat Questions was created out of motivation to help myself and others to be prepared for interviews in the tech industry. In my first white board interview ever I got ask some data structures and algorithms questions. Let's just say I bombed that interview ðŸ˜…. 
                    After that I was determind to be prepared for future interviews, and that's when Hot Seat Questions was born.
